        <h1 class="display-5"> What is pizza ? </h1>
        <font class="lead"> I just returned from Italy, and being in the pizza business I was wandering from one pizza shop to another, always looking for a good pie. After experiencing several different establishments, I came to the conclusion that I prefer American-style pizza. It is my opinion that the U.S. has a better pizza by far. Why? To me, the ingredients we have are much better. While I was there, I had some conversations with many pizza makers and discovered a new movement in the world of pizza. Many Italian pizza makers have banded together to try and regulate what can be called pizza. I listened to their arguments, but as you know, you can’t argue with an Italian. I like one thing, and they like another. It’s regional tastes that determine what is “best.”</font>

        <h1 class="display-5"> How we make pizza ? </h1>
        <p class="lead"> First, put flour, salt, cooking oil, and water into bowl. Then knead dough using your own hand. After the dough blow up, roll it to make a circle. </font>
        <p class="lead"> Second, we are going to make a topping. Grate a mozzarella, and cop mushrooms also bell paper. Next, spread the dough that you have made a circle with sauce and put mozzarella mushrooms and bell paper. You can arrange your own style for the toping. The last step, bake a pizza with an oven approximately 15 minutes. Finally your pizza has already to serve. </font>
        <p class="lead"> In conclusion to make a pizza as delicious as in the restaurant is easy if you follow the three steps above. First make a dough, then prepare for the topping, and arrange it as beautiful as you can. Next bake it. </font>
